        "Exploratory visualizations can be more complicated, as they are used to iteratively ask and answer questions about the data. They may be for private rather than public purposes.",
        "Communicative visualizations tend to be, in a sense, shallower and have a clear point. The purpose would generally be to make a point about the data, to tell a story, to answer a question, etc.",
        "There is a tradeoff in complexity between the two.",
        "You should always have a specific purpose in mind before you make a visualization or present it to someone."
